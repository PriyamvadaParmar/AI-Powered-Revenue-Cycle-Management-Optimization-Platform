# Product Backlog Prioritization Framework  
## AI-Powered Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) Product

Backlog refinement and validation activities include analysis of large datasets using SQL queries to:
- Validate assumptions
- Identify trends and anomalies
- Support prioritization and impact analysis

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **framework used to prioritize product backlog items** for the AI-Powered RCM Product.

It ensures that feature and story prioritization is:
- Consistent
- Transparent
- Aligned with business outcomes
- Responsive to operational realities

---

## 2. Prioritization Objectives

The prioritization framework is designed to:
- Maximize revenue impact
- Reduce operational risk
- Improve user productivity
- Balance short-term wins with long-term scalability
- Ensure predictable and sustainable delivery

---

## 3. Key Prioritization Dimensions

Each backlog item is evaluated across the following dimensions:

### 3.1 Business Impact
- Expected reduction in denial rate  
- Improvement in A/R days or collections  
- Revenue at risk addressed  

---

### 3.2 User Impact
- Number of users affected  
- Frequency of usage  
- Reduction in manual effort or cognitive load  

---

### 3.3 Risk Reduction
- Compliance or SLA risk mitigation  
- Operational failure prevention  
- Dependency resolution  

---

### 3.4 Effort & Complexity
- Engineering effort estimation  
- Data and AI dependencies  
- Integration complexity  

---

### 3.5 Strategic Alignment
- Alignment with product vision and roadmap  
- Reusability across clients  
- Enablement of future capabilities  

---

## 4. Scoring Model (Simplified)

Each dimension is scored on a scale of **1 (Low) to 5 (High)**.

| Dimension | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Business Impact | High |
| User Impact | Medium |
| Risk Reduction | Medium |
| Effort & Complexity | Inverse |
| Strategic Alignment | Medium |

Final prioritization is determined through **relative comparison**, not absolute scoring.

---

## 5. Prioritization Process

1. Product Manager proposes backlog candidates  
2. Engineering provides effort estimates  
3. Ops and stakeholders validate business impact  
4. Items are ranked using the prioritization dimensions  
5. Final prioritization reviewed during sprint planning  

---

## 6. Trade-Off Principles

When conflicts arise, the following principles apply:

- Revenue protection over feature breadth  
- Simplicity over configurability (unless required)  
- Reusability over client-specific customization  
- Stability over speed during high-risk releases  

---

## 7. Handling Change Requests

- Change requests are evaluated against existing priorities  
- Urgent regulatory or payer-driven changes may override planned work  
- All changes are documented with rationale and impact  

---

## 8. Transparency & Communication

- Prioritization decisions are documented  
- Trade-offs are explicitly communicated to stakeholders  
- Backlog order reflects current business reality  

---

## 9. Review Cadence

- Backlog reviewed weekly during grooming  
- Priorities reassessed at the start of each sprint  
- Strategic priorities reviewed quarterly  

---

## 10. Summary

This prioritization framework enables the product team to make **objective, defensible decisions** while remaining adaptable to the dynamic nature of healthcare RCM operations.

It ensures that delivery focus remains on **high-impact, high-value outcomes**.

*This framework guides backlog creation, sprint planning, and roadmap execution.*
