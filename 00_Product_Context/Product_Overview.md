# Product Overview  
## AI-Powered Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) Platform

---

## 1. Product Summary

The **AI-Powered Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) Platform** is a cloud-native healthcare product designed to optimize the end-to-end claim lifecycle for US healthcare providers.

The platform is currently **live in production** and supports operational, billing, AR, and leadership teams by delivering **predictive insights, automated workflows, and real-time visibility** across front-end, mid-cycle, and back-end RCM processes.

The product leverages **AI-driven analytics, workflow automation, and integrated dashboards** to reduce revenue leakage, accelerate reimbursements, and improve operational efficiency at scale.

## 2. Business Objectives

The primary business objectives of the product are:

- Reduce claim denial rates through proactive, AI-based risk detection  
- Decrease Accounts Receivable (A/R) days by improving prioritization and follow-up efficiency  
- Improve First Pass Yield and Net Collection Rate  
- Provide leadership with real-time, actionable RCM insights  
- Standardize workflows across operations while allowing flexibility by payer and provider  

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Healthcare providers face persistent challenges in Revenue Cycle Management due to:

- Reactive denial management instead of proactive prevention  
- Manual, rule-based workflows that do not scale  
- Limited visibility across RCM stages and payer behavior  
- Poor coordination between operations, analytics, and engineering teams  
- High dependency on human intervention for prioritization and exception handling  

These challenges lead to delayed reimbursements, increased rework, higher operational costs, and revenue loss.

- Predicting denial risk before claim submission  
- Automatically prioritizing high-value and high-risk claims  
- Providing unified dashboards across the RCM lifecycle  
- Automating routine workflows while surfacing only true exceptions
