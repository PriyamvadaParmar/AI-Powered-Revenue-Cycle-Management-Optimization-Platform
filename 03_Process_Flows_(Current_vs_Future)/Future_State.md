# Future State Design  
## AI-Powered Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the **future-state (to-be) operating model** for Revenue Cycle Management enabled by the AI-Powered RCM Product.

It outlines how workflows, decision-making, and visibility evolve once the product is fully adopted across RCM operations, and how these changes directly support business outcomes.

---

## 2. Future-State Overview

In the future state, RCM operations transition from **manual, reactive processes** to a **proactive, intelligence-driven operating model**.

Key characteristics of the future state include:
- Early identification and prevention of claim denials  
- Automated prioritization of high-impact work  
- Unified, real-time visibility across the RCM lifecycle  
- Reduced dependency on individual expertise  
- Faster and more predictable cash realization  

---

## 3. Future-State RCM Workflow (High-Level)

1. Patient and insurance data validated at intake  
2. Claims scored for denial risk prior to submission  
3. High-risk claims flagged for corrective action  
4. Claims submitted with optimized accuracy  
5. AR worklists dynamically prioritized by value and risk  
6. Denials routed automatically with recommended actions  
7. Payments tracked, posted, and reconciled  
8. Leadership monitors performance through real-time dashboards  

---

## 4. Key Changes from Current State

### 4.1 From Reactive to Proactive Denial Management
- **Current:** Denials addressed after payer response  
- **Future:** Denial risk predicted before submission  

**Outcome:** Fewer preventable denials and reduced rework

---

### 4.2 From Manual to Intelligent AR Prioritization
- **Current:** Aging-based AR queues  
- **Future:** AI-ranked worklists combining value, risk, and aging  

**Outcome:** Faster collections and reduced A/R days

---

### 4.3 From Fragmented to Unified Visibility
- **Current:** Disparate reports across systems  
- **Future:** Single source of truth with role-based dashboards  

**Outcome:** Better operational and executive decision-making

---

### 4.4 From Experience-Based to Data-Driven Decisions
- **Current:** Decisions rely on individual expertise  
- **Future:** AI recommendations support consistent decision-making  

**Outcome:** Scalable operations with reduced dependency on key individuals

---

## 5. Operating Model Impact

### Operations Teams
- Focus on exceptions and high-impact work  
- Reduced manual effort and cognitive load  
- Clear prioritization and accountability  

### Leadership
- Real-time insight into revenue performance  
- Early identification of risks and bottlenecks  
- Data-backed strategic decisions  

### Product & Engineering
- Clear feedback loops based on usage and outcomes  
- Faster iteration driven by measurable impact  
- Improved cross-functional alignment  

---

## 6. Governance & Controls

- AI outputs function as **decision support**, not autonomous actions  
- Full auditability of recommendations and overrides  
- Role-based access controls and approvals  
- Continuous monitoring of performance and accuracy  

---

## 7. Expected Business Outcomes

- Reduced claim denial rates  
- Improved First Pass Yield  
- Reduced Accounts Receivable (A/R) days  
- Improved Net Collection Rate  
- Increased operational productivity  

---

## 8. Transition Considerations

- Phased rollout by workflow and client  
- Change management and training for ops teams  
- Incremental adoption of AI-driven features  
- Continuous feedback and refinement  

---

## 9. Summary

The future-state RCM operating model enables healthcare providers to **move from reactive revenue recovery to proactive revenue optimization**.

By embedding intelligence and automation directly into day-to-day workflows, the AI-Powered RCM Product delivers sustainable financial and operational improvements while maintaining control, transparency, and compliance.
