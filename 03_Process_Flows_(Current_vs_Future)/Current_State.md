# Current State Analysis  
## Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) – As-Is Process

---

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the **current (as-is) state** of Revenue Cycle Management operations prior to the introduction of the AI-Powered RCM Product.

The objective is to:
- Establish a baseline for process inefficiencies
- Identify operational gaps and pain points
- Create a foundation for future-state improvements

---

## 2. Overview of Current RCM Operations

In the current state, RCM operations are largely **manual, reactive, and fragmented** across multiple teams and systems.

Processes span:
- Front-end registration and eligibility checks  
- Mid-cycle coding and charge capture  
- Back-end claim submission, AR follow-up, and denial management  

Each stage operates with limited visibility into upstream and downstream activities.

## 3. Current-State RCM Workflow (High-Level)

1. Patient registration and insurance details captured manually  
2. Eligibility verification performed using payer portals or batch files  
3. Charges entered and coded by billing teams  
4. Claims submitted to payers  
5. Denials received post-submission  
6. AR teams manually review, prioritize, and follow up on unpaid claims  
7. Payments posted and reconciled  

---

## 4. Key Pain Points

### 4.1 Reactive Denial Management
- Denials are identified **after submission**
- Root causes are analyzed too late
- High volume of preventable denials

---

### 4.2 Manual Prioritization of AR
- AR teams rely on aging buckets only
- High-value claims often missed
- No risk-based or value-based prioritization

---

### 4.3 Limited Visibility Across RCM Lifecycle
- Data scattered across systems
- No unified dashboard
- Leadership lacks real-time insights

---

### 4.4 High Dependency on Human Judgment
- Rule-based decisions lack consistency
- Knowledge concentrated with senior staff
- Difficult to scale operations

---

### 4.5 Inefficient Collaboration
- Ops, analytics, and engineering teams work in silos
- Feedback loops are slow
- Improvements take weeks or months to implement

---

## 5. Impact of Current State

- Increased claim denial rates  
- Higher Accounts Receivable (A/R) days  
- Revenue leakage  
- Increased operational costs  
- Reduced staff productivity and morale

## 6. Summary of Current-State Gaps

| Area | Gap |
|----|----|
| Denial Management | Reactive, post-submission |
| AR Follow-up | Manual, aging-based |
| Visibility | Fragmented reporting |
| Automation | Minimal |
| Decision-Making | Experience-based, not data-driven |

*This current-state analysis highlights the need for proactive intelligence, automation, and unified visibility, which are addressed in the future-state design.*
