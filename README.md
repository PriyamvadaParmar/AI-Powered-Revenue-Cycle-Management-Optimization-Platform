## Overview

This repository showcases a **full-scale Product Management case study** focused on building an **AI-powered Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) platform** for US healthcare providers.

The product is designed to address **revenue leakage, claim denials, delayed reimbursements, and operational inefficiencies** by combining:

- Predictive analytics  
- Workflow automation  
- Integrated dashboards  
- Agile product delivery  

This project reflects **real-world product ownership responsibilities** including requirement discovery, backlog management, sprint planning, stakeholder collaboration, and feature acceptance.

## Business Problem

US healthcare providers face significant financial and operational challenges due to:

- High claim denial rates  
- Manual and reactive workflows  
- Poor visibility across RCM stages

These challenges result in:
- Increased Accounts Receivable (A/R) days  
- Lower first-pass yield  
- Revenue loss  
- High operational costs
